      <p>achieving adequate performance, if it divides its efforts among many alterna-<br>tives.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a point that is the very essence of strategy is knowing how to choose<br>
        what to do and what not to do. The development of competitive strategy has<br>
        a broad nature involving how the company will compete, what its goals should<br>
        be, and what policies are necessary to achieving these goals.</p>
      <p>This spectrum of choices contains two groups of factors that influence deci-<br>sions: the external competitive environment in which the company is active and<br>
        its own internal characteristics. In turn, each of these unfolds into two other<br>
        factors.</p>
    <p>Both the threats to companies and their opportunities are to be found in the<br>
        competitive environment. Internally, the company has both strengths and<br>
        weaknesses. The SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, and Threats)<br>
        analysis has the objective of recognizing limitations, maximizing the organiza-<br>tions’ strong points while monitoring opportunities and threats in the competi-<br>tive environment. Models, such the Structure Analysis of Industry (Porter,<br>
        1979), help to understand the external environment. There are models such as<br>
        Core Competencies (Prahalad & Hamel, 1990) which lend themselves to<br>
        analyzing the internal situation of companies. Both types of models will be<br>
        studied in later chapters of this book.</p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good Strategy. Can a Good<br>
        Strategy Be Replicated or is There a<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formula for a Good Strategy?</b></p>
        <hr style="height: 2px; color: black; background-color: black;">
        <p>According to Porter, the choice of an adequate positioning aims at determining<br>
            which activities the company should carry out and also which it should not. As<br>
            a consequence, the company should conceive of an internal configuraton<br>
            appropriate for executing these activities and also how the activities will be<br>
            related amongst themselves. This interrelationship among activities should seek<br>
            not just compatibilization, but reciprocal reinforcement as well, thus increasing<br>
            the potential to obtain the competitive advantage desired by the company.</p>
        <p>According to this reasoning, Porter considers the existence of three levels of<br>
            compatibilization, which could sometimes occur simultaneously: consistency of</p><hr><hr>
    <p>activities with the company’s strategy, mutual reinforcement among the activi-<br>ties, and optimization of effort.</p>
    <p><i>Consistency</i> between company strategy and each activity in the functional<br>
        realm is the first level of compatibilization, which prompts accumulation (and<br>
        not contradiction) of the competitive advantage of these activities. This creates<br>
        a single vision of strategy, which improves its implementation as well as<br>
        facilitating its communication and its transmission to clients, employees, and<br>
        shareholders. The American airline company, Southwest (the model for the<br>
        Brazilian GOL), for example, suspended on-board meals and promoted more<br>
        frequent rotation of planes within its strategy for low cost, marketing to a price-<br>sensitive public looking for convenience.</p>
    <p>At the next level, not just consistency is sought, but rather that there be a mutual<br>
        reinforcement among activities so that they produce mutually reinforcing<br>
        effects. Software companies put test versions (the so-called beta versions) of<br>
        their product at the disposal of some users. Testing these versions through use<br>
        permits errors to be corrected, features to be changed, and also reinforces the<br>
        intent of the users to use the software.</p>
    <p>When compatiblization reaches the third level, there is an optimization of effort.<br>
        The most basic form of this optimization involves the flow of information and<br>
        coordination, with a view to eliminating redundancies and minimizing losses.<br>
        There are more elaborate forms, such as those used in the development of<br>
        product designs that transfer installation and support activities to the user or the<br>
        establishment of partnerships with suppliers and distribution channels. For<br>
        instance, limited menus in fast-food chains allow them to maintain quick service<br>
        with a standardized operational efficiency consistent with their purposes.</p>
    <p>Note that these compatibility factors indicate that the set of activities, and not<br>
        each activity, is what is important to establishing and maintaining competitive<br>
        advantage. Concern with the search for excellence in performance of individual<br>
        activities is a feature of operational efficiency; it is not a strategy. For Porter<br>
        (1996), it is the totality of the system of activities that emanates competitive<br>
        advantage and consequently, the success of strategy. Efficiency in individual<br>
        activities, as we have seen, can be more easily copied than this integration of<br>
        activities within the company.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, market pressures generate an environment that some call “hyper-<br>competition” and in this circumstance, companies often limit themselves to<br>
        imitating their rivals, and this alone reinforces competition since it levels ,the<br>
        antagonists. Acting in this way, the companies cease to have a strategy, since<br>
        they stop making the necessary choices.</p><hr><hr>
    <p>This scenario favors seeking operational efficiency since it can generate<br>
        palpable results in little time and the companies are focused on performance<br>
        measures. It appears to be a more certain route than assuming the risks of<br>
        making decisions about strategy, which means letting go of some things in favor<br>
        of others. These choices also can force the company to abdicate some clients<br>
        and some income, which from the immediate perspective, is not attractive. .</p>
    <p>This does not mean that operational efficiency is not desirable; increasing it is<br>
        a necessary part of managing a company, however, it is not a strategy. Both<br>
        operational efficiency and strategy are very important, but different due to their<br>
        different focuses.</p>
    <p>Operational efficiency is focused on continuous improvements to all aspects<br>
        and not making mutually exclusive choices, which is intrinsically different than<br>
        making trade offs. In this context, there is a search for constant changes,<br>
        flexibility, and a continuous effort to achieve the best practices. On the other<br>
        hand, the focus of strategy aims at defining a unique position, making very clear<br>
        trade-offs and making activities compatible. To accomplish this, ways of<br>
        reinforcing the company’s position are continuously sought and this requires<br>
        discipline and continuity.</p>
    <p>Therefore, strategic continuity does not mean having a static view of the<br>
        competitive scenario. The company will need to change its strategy if there are<br>
        significant changes in the structure of the industry. Meanwhile, the choice of a<br>
        new position should be guided by the ability to make new trade-offs and to<br>
        develop a new system of complementary activities, (which makes the search for<br>
        continued improvements more efficacious) to obtain a sustainable advantage.</p>
    <p>Campbell and Alexander similarly stress that companies and managers develop<br>
        “fads” such as TQM (<i>total quality management</i>), benchmarking, and<br>
        reengineering, and others, seeking to stay out in front of their competitors. In<br>
        turn, these adopt the same fads, (in addition to generating others), under the risk<br>
        of not obtaining the competitive advantage if their rivals do so and are<br>
        successful. It can be seen then that fads produce better results, but do not<br>
        resolve issues in the long-term since they do not usually lead to developing<br>
        strategy.</p>
    <p>Markides (1999) complements the above perspectives, warning that unique<br>
        strategic positions are transitory. More aggressive competitors will seek to<br>
        imitate these positions if they prove to be attractive, and in fact, no strategic<br>
        position is truly unique. In addition, given the dynamics of business activities,<br>
        new strategic positions arise continuously.</p><hr><hr>

    <p>New positions occur based on new combinations of responses to three basic<br>
        questions: who, what, and how to challenge the dominance of the reigning<br>
        positions. Thus, in reaching a new segment of consumers, by creating a new<br>
        value proposal or even a new means of producing or distributing a product, the<br>
        business will be creating a new strategic position.</p>
    <p>This process can occur in any industry, if the same apparently inexpugnable<br>
        strategies can be overthrown by unknown companies that base themselves in<br>
        the creation and exploration of new strategic positions in an industry.</p>
    <p>Markides shows that this process begins with the “dominant” enterprises in<br>
        industry creating unique strategic positions. “Traditional” companies (perhaps<br>
        “traditionalist” is better said) imitate these dominant companies, seeking to<br>
        obtain part of the market. On the other hand, there are more and more “strategic<br>
        innovators”, who conquer large parcels of the market, frequently of the new<br>
        markets that they help to create. Among examples of this last type of company,<br>
        the author included, among others, Canon (commented upon in the box above)<br>
        and Dell (commented upon further along in this chapter).</p>
    <p>Note that Hamel (1996) made an analogous classification, dividing companies<br>
        into three types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Rule makers</b>: these are the leaders who build an industry, the dominant<br>
            oligarch. They include large companies such as IBM, United Airlines,<br>
            Coca Cola, and Hertz, the car rental agency.</li>
        <li><b>Rule tailers</b>:these render tribute to the industry leaders, which for Hamel<br>
            is very little to serve as a strategy. For examples we can site Fujitsu,<br>
            McDonnell Douglas, and Avis, the car rental agency</li>
        <li><b>Rule breakers</b>: companies that rewrite the rules, inverting the order of<br>
            things in the industries where they are active, these are the discontent,<br>
            radical, and revolutionary of the industry. Dell computer would fall into<br>
            this category as well as the watch maker Swatch and Southwest Airlines.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>Returning to Markides view, it is not possible to predict what the emerging strategic<br>
        positions will be. Therefore, in facing market uncertainties, companies have two<br>
        generic options: innovate or exploit the innovations of another company. Note that<br>
        both options can be adopted by either established enterprises or by new entrants.<br>
        Thus strategy is essentially dynamic and, in this context, a business should be<br>
        guided by the following points:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Establish a distinctive strategic position in the industry where it is active.</li>
        <li>Compete on the basis of this position in order to be better than the industry<br>
            competition</li>
        <li>Constantly be on the lookout for new strategic positions.</li>
        <li>When identifying another viable strategic position in the industry, the<br>
            company should attempt the difficult task of administering both positions<br>
            simultaneously. To the extent that the old position matures and begins to<br>
            decline, the company should gradually make a transition to the new<br>
            position. The cycle then should be recommenced: when competing in the<br>
            new position, the search for yet another new viable strategic position<br>
            should continue.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>In this process, the company should eventually make a leap to a new technology<br>
        or even into another industry. However, in moving to a new industry the<br>
        company should repeat the process of dynamic strategy.</p>
    <p>Thus, for Markides, strategy means that the companies, even those that are<br>
        presently successful, should continuously revise and challenge their responses<br>
        to the questions: who, what, and how, in order to remain flexible and ready to<br>
        adjust their strategies in the eventuality that market responses not be favorable.</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: 16px; padding-left: 16%;"><b>Characteristics and Elements of<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitive Strategy</b></p>
        <hr style="height: 2px; color: black; background-color: black;">
    <p>To finalize this chapter which discusses the concept of strategy, it is worth<br>
        making some final comments about the nature and characteristics of competitive strategy.</p>
    <p>In addition, there is a question about who should be concerned with the<br>
        company’s strategy. For several authors, developing strategy is the main<br>
        objective of the executives of a business.</p>
    <p>Hamel (1996) however, has a different opinion, stating that strategy should be<br>
        a matter disseminated at various levels of the hierarchy, based on his point of<br>
        view that strategy should be of a revolutionary nature.</p>
    <p>In Hamel’s view, upper-level executives are impregnated with industry dogma,<br>
        have more homogenous experiences, and a strong connection to what was</p><hr><hr>
    <p>done in the past. Thus, it is unlikely that they will become the promoters of the<br>
        revolution that he preaches must occur for companies to remain competitive.<br>
        The revolutionaries, however can be found in all companies and at different<br>
        levels of the hierarchy, and should be engaged in a discussion of the future, thus<br>
        becoming “strategy activists”. The company should change perspective, in-<br>volving the highest levels of the hierarchy (where the monopoly on allocating<br>
        resources lies) as well as the mid and lower levels (where there is more<br>
        imagination and propensity to change). The process of developing strategy in<br>
        itself should be seen as a strategy involving all levels of the company in such a<br>
        way as to make possible the changes needed for the survival and success of the<br>
        company.</p>
    <p>Henderson (1989), some basic elements are present in a competitive strategy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The ability to understand the competitive environment as an interactive<br>
            system (competitors, customers, money, people, resources).</li>
        <li>Ability in using this understanding to predict the effects of a strategic move.</li>
        <li>Resources can be committed to new uses even when the benefits are not<br>
            immediate.</li>
        <li>Ability in foreseeing the risks and returns with sufficient accuracy to justify<br>
            the new use of resources.</li>
        <li>Disposition for action.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>As has been observed, strategy is revolutionary (here used in a less “subver-<br>sive” sense than in Hamel’s view), since it is deliberate, and aimed at rapid<br>
        changes in competitive relations. According to Henderson (1989), there are<br>
        factors inhibiting this revolutionary nature — the failure and advantages inherent<br>
        in the position of an attentive defender.</p>
    <p>Over time, one can observe alternating periods of more or less heightened<br>
        competition. Further, beginning at the end of the 20th century, the periods of<br>
        calm have become shorter.</p>
    <p>Strategy depends on subjective judgments of one’s own actions and those of one’s<br>
        rivals.<i>A posteriori</i> analysis of events reveals that it is not always the strategy which<br>
        appears evident that had been previously imagined.</p>
    <p>For Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, and Lampel (1998), strategy has the following<br>
        aspects, present in the different schools they studied:</p><hr><hr>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Having to do with the organization as well as the environment:</b><br>
            There is a need for an organization to know itself as well as the<br>
            environment in which it operates.</li>
        <li><b>Its essence is complex:</b> The process of defining and implementing<br>
            strategy involves several, often conflicting variables</li>
        <li><b>Affects the overall welfare of the organization:</b> The impact of a good<br>
            or bad strategy permeates the entire organization.</li>
        <li><b>Involves issues of content as well as process:</b> A well-thought-out and<br>
            planned strategy needs adequate implementation. Likewise, one can think<br>
            of the need for an adequate process to conceive strategy</li>
        <li><b>It is not purely deliberative:</b> Strategy can be deliberated (planned, the<br>
            result of will), but it frequently is a result of events and opportunities that<br>
            appear in the course of a company’s activities; in these circumstances, the<br>
            strategy is called emergent.</li>
        <li><b>Exists at several levels:</b> There is corporate strategy, which determines<br>
            in which business to be active, and also business strategy, which seeks the<br>
            best means of competing in a given business area.</li>
        <li><b>Involves several thought processes:</b> Strategy involves work in con-<br>ceptualizing as well as analyzing the situation. Therefore, the elements<br>
            present in strategy are there so that one can understand the process of<br>
            developing business strategy. In the chapters which follow, these factors<br>
            will be discussed in detail.</li>

        <p><b>Case – A Modern Conflict: Apple vs. IBM, The First<br>
            Personal Computer War</b></p>
        <hr style="height: 2px; color: black; background-color: black; font-size: 16px;">
    <p>The 1970s — at that time, the computer market was heavily dominated by IBM<br>
        and its enormous mainframes, also maintaining the greatest market share, and<br>
        the largest profits as well.</p>
    <p>A new company launched a product that initially had more of an entertainment<br>
        than a work function. The company was Apple and the product, the microcom-</p><hr><hr>
    
    <p>puter. Based on the ideas that its buyers liked to work with electronics, it had<br>
        modular components and several slots that permitted a number of improve-<br>ments and expansions. Meanwhile, new software for the microcomputer<br>
        (called Apple II+) introduced the industry to a new course: the electronic<br>
        spreadsheet. The appearance of the first electronic spreadsheet (Visicalc)<br>
        showed the enormous potential the microcomputers had for business. Apple<br>
        II+ sales grew at an amazing rate and other microcomputer manufacturers leapt<br>
        in to dispute the new market.</p>
    <p>At first IBM did not react. But the growth of microcomputer sales began to<br>
        discomfit the mainframe market. IBM’s first attempt at reacting was to deny<br>
        that the microcomputer had the potential to replace the mainframe. Later, it<br>
        realized its error and launched the concept of end-user product, which was<br>
        software for mainframes. This was more user-friendly, which was one of the<br>
        main arguments in favor of microcomputers. The results were not what IBM<br>
        had wanted. A new strategy was needed. In an attempt to gain time, IBM<br>
        sought partners to launch its first microcomputer, in an intense outsourcing<br>
        process. Its main partners became Intel for the micro processing chip and<br>
        Microsoft for the software. The IBM PC introduced in 1981 (followed by the<br>
        PC XT in 1983 and PC AT in 1984) was a big success and became the market<br>
        standard whose descendents are on the market today.</p>
    <p>Later, the PC industry moved on to new victories. For the time being, IBM<br>
        remained in an advantageous position.</p>
    <p>Returning to the story at the beginning of this chapter, one can imagine an<br>
        analogy with military strategy. Apple attacked IBM’s territory with a very<br>
        innovative strategy. IBM initially insisted on fighting on its own ground, tried<br>
        guerrilla warfare, and finally attacked Apple on its own territory and managed<br>
        a victory.</p>
    <p>The use of the analogy, especially to military strategy, is very common in the<br>
        studying of business strategy. Nevertheless, certain caution should be exer-<br>cised since this is a resource to facilitate understanding and should not be taken<br>
        literally. As was said regarding von Clausewitz, analogies should be used as a<br>
        source of inspiration.</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Case – Sources of Strategic Positioning: Lojas Yamada</b></p>
    <hr style="height: 2px; color: black; background-color: black;">
    <p>The Grupo Yamada, a chain of stores in the state of Pará, founded by the<br>
        Japanese immigrant Yoshio Yamada 50 years ago, made a “preferential option</p><hr><hr>

    <p>for the poor” and became the largest retail chain in its state. Exploiting the<br>
        peculiarities of local customs and creating stores for the low-income customer<br>
        in the informal economy (popcorn vendors, open air market vendors, manicur-<br>ists, domestic employees, and ambulatory vendors), it experienced an extraor-<br>dinary rate of growth in its sales from 63 million reais to 379 million in 1999.<br>
        To attain this result, it facilitated credit for people without a stable or registered<br>
        employment, opened up space for those in the informal economy (which<br>
        absorbs 40% of the economically active population), and 70% of its clientele<br>
        are low-income customers. The principal credit mechanism is the company’s<br>
        own credit card which is responsible for almost 80% of the chain’s income.</p>
    <p>Even though these customers had shown themselves to be better payers than<br>
        was supposed, as a preventive measure, the company created a credit and<br>
        payment management system unique in the country, that utilizes specialized<br>
        informants as well as a computerized system of credit analysis. With this, they<br>
        can evaluate a client’s credit application in 15 minutes. However, it overlooks<br>
        overdue payments when this will lead to customer loyalty and offers life<br>
        insurance (to ensure payments), permanent disability, and loss of income.</p>
    <p>In addition, Yamada knows how to deal with local logistical difficulties and<br>
        knows its customers’ peculiarities, which include the typical local cuisine.</p>
    <p>In this way, the company sought a strategic position based in the creation of a<br>
        differentiated form of access to consumption for low-income clients.</p>
    <p>Adapted from Revista Exame (November 15, 2000, Edition 727)</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Case – Copying Strategies for Copying?</b></p>
    <hr style="height: 2px; color: black; background-color: black;">
    <p>According to Markides, an illustrative example of seeking a unique strategic<br>
        position can be found in the photocopying industry. Xerox was the leader in this<br>
        market in the 1960s with a singular and defined strategy which prioritized<br>
        corporate clients and focused on the production of large copiers which were<br>
        rented, not sold, by its own sales force. In the 1970s, weighty rivals such as<br>
        IBM and Kodak adopted the same or similar strategies but did not manage to<br>
        achieve similar success. Both sought the same large corporate market and IBM<br>
        even adopted the practice of rental.</p>
    <p>Canon, in turn, came to be the leader (in terms of volume) in the 1980s, serving<br>
        small and medium companies as well as the end user with smaller copying<br>
        machines with attractive pricing and quality. The machines were sold — not</p><hr><hr>

    <p>rented — and their commercialization was done through a network of interme-<br>diaries.</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Case – The Second PC War: Dell Computer<br>
        Corporation vs. IBM and COMPAQ</b></p>
    <hr style="height: 2px; color: black; background-color: black;">
    <p>Among the many companies that began to manufacture microcomputers on the<br>
        PC standard, one presented a new form of working that had a big impact on<br>
        its results. This is the Dell Computer Corporation.</p>
    <p>Founded in 1984, it began by making upgrades of IBM PC clones. Beginning<br>
        in 1985, it started to produce its own computers.</p>
    <p>Dell analyzed the direct competition and perceived that IBM, Compaq, and<br>
        Hewlett Packard (HP) sold through intermediaries. As a consequence, there<br>
        was an increase in stock and costs and the response time for final consumers<br>
        was slow. Michael Dell, founder, president, and CEO of Dell Computer,<br>
        resolved then to sell directly to end-consumers. This means an intense effort to<br>
        reconceptualize stock management, logistics, and all the administration of the<br>
        supply chain. Further, Dell concentrated on selling to companies to whom it<br>
        could sell machines of higher value.</p>
    <p>In fine tune with the supply chain, it was possible to reduce both time and cost<br>
        of production and distribution.</p>
    <p>Even though the basic ideas of this strategy were present from the beginning,<br>
        the grand catalyst was the advent and dissemination of the Internet, which<br>
        greatly facilitated its implementation. Before this, Dell had undergone difficul-<br>ties due to the obsolescence of a lot of existing microprocessors in large<br>
        quantity in its stock, as well as having tried unsuccessfully to commercialize its<br>
        PC’s through retail outlets.</p>
    <p>In Dell’s formula, not only are sales direct to clients, but production is only<br>
        initiated when an order is placed. Further, the company focuses on service<br>
        delivery and technical assistance, by telephone and house calls. Products,<br>
        targeted on companies as a priority, include the most recent technological<br>
        advances and therefore, have a higher added value.</p>
    <p>Consistently acting in this way, Dell billed more than 30 billion dollars in 2001,<br>
        becoming the largest company in the PC sector, still in an intense dispute with<br>
        HP.</p><hr><hr>


    <p>Therefore, in terms of Markides ideas about dynamic strategy, Dell innovated<br>
        significantly in the “how” to develop its activities and was a revolutionary<br>
        company.</p>
    <p>Adapted from news on the <i>Portal Exame</i> and from Reid & Sanders (2002).</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Case – Remedies for Strategy and Strategy for Remedies</b></p>
    <hr style="height: 2px; color: black; background-color: black;">
    <p>The Distribuidora de Medicamentos Panarello, of the state of Goiânia, was<br>
        founded by Paulo Panarello of São Paulo and is the largest Brazilian company<br>
        in the remedy distribution sector of approximately 300 companies. Its trajec-<br>tory is of interest to the study of strategy.</p>
    <p>The company billed 870 million dollars in 2000 (15.7% of retail medicine sales<br>
        in the national market) which represents significant growth in relation to the 200<br>
        million of six years earlier.</p>
    <p>The founder had to help with family finance from the age of eight, selling<br>
        popsicles made by his mother in open-air markets. Later he had his own<br>
        businesses, starting with a car mechanic shop, then a fleet of taxis, a restaurant,<br>
        and a construction firm for low-income clients. At the time he was not yet 25<br>
        years old.</p>
    <p>A stroke of luck helped to shape his future when a sister-in-law married<br>
        Emiliano Sanches, the owner of SEM laboratories, a major producer of generic<br>
        drugs. He then represented EMS in Goiania. In this city, Panarello opened a<br>
        drug distributor that started small. However, right away he obtained conces-<br>sions from other laboratories, expanding his business at first to the rest of the<br>
        state of Goiás and later to the states of Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, finally<br>
        achieving coverage of 21 states in the northeast, central-western, southeast,<br>
        and southern regions of the country by the mid-1990s. The northern region,<br>
        except Tocantins, was left out of his plans due to difficulties and the cost of<br>
        access.</p>
    <p>Thus, the company became the drug distributor with the largest geographic<br>
        coverage, obtaining a big competitive advantage since there are more than<br>
        50,000 pharmacies dispersed throughout Brazil, which makes direct distribu-<br>tion nonviable.</p>
    <p>Panarello’s team of 900 sales representatives uses telemarketing and electronic<br>
        commerce. One of the company’s strengths is services provided to laboratories<br>
        (such as when new drugs are launched) and also partnerships with pharmacies</p><hr><hr>


    <p>(for whom Panarello provides financing and more generous payment terms than<br>
        the average practice in the sector).</p>
    <p>In the 1980s, two circumstances helped drive the growth of the company. First,<br>
        there were large gains made from the financial markets during the high inflation<br>
        period prior to the Plano Real economic program, thanks to long-term payment<br>
        plans with it suppliers. The second factor was obtaining generous financial<br>
        benefits conceded by the government of Goias. Thus, Panarello was able to<br>
        begin the new decade with more resources on-hand than the competitors.</p>
    <p>In this context, in the mid-1990s, approximately half of the cmpanies in the<br>
        sector failed, including many of his largest rivals, who did not adapt themselves<br>
        to the end of the inflationary times. Further, many distributors also had their own<br>
        pharmacies which caused problems with lack of focus. Panarello then concen-<br>trated on serving isolated pharmacies, taking advantage of the spaces not<br>
        served by competitors.</p>
    <p>The company was also concerned with its operational efficiency. It invested<br>
        more than one million dollars installing computerized conveyors in its Porto<br>
        Alegre and São Paulo affiliates, which automatically separate orders (accepted<br>
        up to 100 reais—approximately 40 dollars), thus making service quicker. All<br>
        the lots are registered in a computerized system that identifies individual sales.<br>
        IT acquired a system for integrated management (the R3 by SAP) that in<br>
        addition to controlling all activities, also serves as a marketing tool against<br>
        competition. This is because it makes it possible to collect a large quantity of<br>
        information about storeowners and this can be used as bargaining power with<br>
        the laboratories.</p>
    <p>For reasons of security, all delivery vehicles are tracked by satellite and radio<br>
        and have armed escorts.</p>
    <p>Finally, it contracted a large consulting firm to develop a plan to professionalize<br>
        the company.</p>
    <p>With these precautions and its integration and infrastructure, the company felt<br>
        ready to confront both national and foreign competitors. Its proposal is to grow<br>
        based in generic medicines whose gross margins are larger (20% vs. 16% for<br>
        conventionals), without ceasing to explore new markets such as distributing<br>
        cosmetics, which comprise 20% of sales in pharmacies.</p>
    <p>The main idea is “to earn less over more units sold.”</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Questions for Reflection and Discussion</b></p>
<hr style="height: 2px; color: black; background-color: black;">
 <ol>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the difference between prescriptive and descriptive approaches<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to strategy?</li><br>
    <p>Considering the case in the section titled A Modern Conflict: Apple vs. IBM,<br>
        The First Personal Computer War, answer the following question:<br></p>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many authors Machiavelli’s phrase “the ends justify the means”<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actually had the sense of “the ends determine the means.” Where can this<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be found in the history of Apple vs. IBM</li><br>
    <p>Considering the case in the section titled Sources of Strategic Positioning:<br>
        Lojas Yamada, answer the following questions:</p>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explain how Lojas Yamada constructed its differentiated position.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Porter stated that sometimes differentiated positioning derives from more<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than one source simultaneously. Aside from the one mentioned above,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what other source can be present?</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What trade-offs does a company need to make? For what reasons?</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it be possible for another company to copy this positioning?</li><br>
    <p>Considering the case in the section titled Copying Strategies for Copying?,<br>
        answer the following questions:</p><br>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on Porter and Markides’s ideas about positioning, explain the<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;success of Xerox and Canon and the failures of IBM and Kodak.</li><br>
    <p>Considering the case in the section titled The Second PC War: Dell Computer<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporation vs. IBM and COMPAQ, answer the following questions:<br></p><br>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what respect was Dell revolutionary?</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What opportunities did Dell exploit for its success?</li><hr><hr>

    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did Dell make its activities compatible with its strategy?</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way does Dell differ fundamentally from Apple in terms of<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strategy?</li><br>
    <p>Considering the case in the section titled The Second PC War: Dell Computer<br>
        Corporation vs. IBM and COMPAQ, answer the following questions:</p><br>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Panarello case reveal a process of strategy development that is<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intentional or emerging?</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the description of Panarello’s trajectory, which are the choices in<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strategic thinking that best apply?</li>
    <li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the source of the company’s positioning?</li>
    <li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is its operational efficiency made compatible with its strategy? If<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;competitors copy this efficiency can they threaten the company?</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about Panarello, Dell, Yamada, and even McDonalds. Does their<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way of acting show a strategy or a search for operational efficiency?</li>
